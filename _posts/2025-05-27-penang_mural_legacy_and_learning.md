# Legacy and Learning  
*Ink painting from Penang, Malaysia*

In this mural, an elderly farmer stands barefoot by his plow, guiding a water buffalo with a young boy perched atop. The child, clutching a text and reaching toward a drifting straw hat, appears animated—caught between study and play. The elder, gaze raised, follows the boy’s gesture, his demeanor a blend of patience and quiet joy. The buffalo, steady and alert, completes the trio, symbolizing harmony between human effort, nature, and transmission of wisdom.

Alongside, a **calligraphic inscription** proclaims:

> 詩書傳家久  
> 耕讀繼世長  
> *“Poetry and books pass down through the family for a long time.  
> Farming and studying continue from generation to generation.”*

This classical couplet embodies Confucian ideals, celebrating the dignity of labor and the continuity of learning. Together, the scene and the inscription reflect a peaceful rhythm of rural life in which tradition and vitality coexist.
